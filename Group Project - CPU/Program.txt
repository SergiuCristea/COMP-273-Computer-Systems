Setup: we need to put a number into the data cache at address 0, and a 1 into the data cache at address 3


# data: 
# address 0 holds the number to be multiplied
# address 1 holds the partial sum 
# address 2 holds the input/counter
# address 3 holds 1

main:                     # address:
	INP R1            # 0
	STR R1, 2         # 1     save the input number to address 2
	LD R0, 0          # 2     load address 0 into R0
	LD R1, 1          # 3     load address 1 into R1 (should be zero initially, will hold the previous sum afterwards)
	ADD R0, R1        # 4     add R0 to the previous sum 
	STR R0, 1         # 5     store the result in address 1
	LD R1, 2	  # 6     load the counter into R1
	LD R0, 3          # 7     load 1 into R0
	SUB R0, R1	  # 8     decrement the counter
	STR R0, 2         # 9     store the counter back
	BNZ R0, 2          # 10    if the counter is zero (before the decrement), we can display, if not add again
	LD R0, 1          # 11
	PRT R0            # 12
	RETURN		  # 13
